Birds have long captured our fascination.

Their iconic flights, vibrant plumage, and diverse melodies inspired culture, poetry, music, science, and engineering. In the last decades, we have also realized that they are **insanely intelligent**. They are truly **cognitive creatures**.

In 2000, a remarkable discovery was made in zebra finches.

A study published in the prestigious journal *Science* analyzed the brain activity of these birds when dreaming. They found that the same brain regions involved in song production were activated (Dave & Margoliash, 2000).

**Zebra finches were replaying their songs in what looked like a dream.**

Years later, an Argentinian researcher tried to listen to these dreams.

This is the story of **Gabriel Mindlin**, the man who listened to the dream of a bird.

## **Zebra Finches: Tiny Birds, Big Discoveries**  
Let us present the protagonists of this story.

**Zebra finches** (*Taeniopygia guttata*) are small songbirds belonging to the class *Aves* and the family *Estrildidae*. They are from Australia and are known for their characteristic **black-and-white striped chests** and **orange beaks**.

These birds are the **most studied** in neuroscience.

They are crucial for scientific research. Thanks to them, we now know a lot about **vocal learning, social behavior, and brain plasticity**. Oh, and these birds are **the best non-human animal models for studying human language acquisition**.

**Male Zebra Finches learn their songs from their fathers.**

This is much like how **humans learn language**. They memorize songs during a **sensitive period** and practice until they master them. Surprisingly, they use **similar brain regions to humans** responsible for speech.

And wait until you find out **what happens in their brains when they sleep**.

## **Replaying Their Songs In Their Dreams**  
This discovery **revolutionized** the science of sleep.

**Replay** consists of **replaying neural activity patterns during sleep**. For example, you may have dreamed about what you did in your day. Well, scientists found that these birds **replay the songs they practiced while awake**.

This discovery means that **learning doesnâ€™t stop when we go to sleep**.

By replaying the songs they are learning, these birds **solidify the neural pathways of these vocal sequences**, therefore reinforcing memory. This is **similar** to how humans replay memories or practice motor skills when sleeping.

But this also means these birds **could have subjective experiences**.

And Gabriel found a way **to listen to their dreams**.

## **How Gabriel Listened to the Song of a Bird**  
One day, **Gabriel Mindlin** received an urgent email from a colleague.

This person was **Amish Dave**, who discovered **replay in Zebra Finches**. In this email, he told Gabriel that he had **forgotten to disconnect the recording instruments** of the bird he was studying. He went to sleep without turning off the instruments!

Amish was studying the **muscle movements in the birdâ€™s throat**.

When he went back, the bird was sleeping. But in the data from the registers, he found that the **Zebra Finch was still moving its throat muscles like it was singing**. 

The bird was **sleeping but still moving its throat like singing**.

---

### **The Brilliant Idea**
Based on this, **Gabriel had a great idea**.

He had been studying **the physics and dynamics of vocal production** for quite some time. Over the years, he designed a **program** capable of generating **a synthetic version of a sound using throat muscle movement as an input**.

He had been doing this **in humans**. 

But now, he had **data from a sleeping bird**.

> **"Could I replicate and generate a synthetic sound of this sleeping bird?"** he thought.

If this worked, he could **literally listen to the dream of a bird**, as the **muscle movements of the sleeping bird almost perfectly matched those when the bird sings awake**.

---

## **The First Time a Human Heard an Animalâ€™s Dream**  
He used the data provided by Amish and **tried to create a synthetic sound from it**.

The next morning, he turned on his computer excitedly. 

He took some coffee and sat down. Next, he put on his earphones and uploaded the **throat muscle data** to his program. Clicked **play** and listened.

**He started laughing.**

Gabriel **did it**. For the first time in human history, he was **listening to the dream of an animal**. Happiness overwhelmed his body and senses. He was smiling **face to face in the laboratory**, speechless, emotionally.

Everyone looked at him, **wondering what was going on with their director**.

---

## **A Scientific Breakthrough**  
Months later, he and his team published their results in *Nature*.

A bunch of **physics, dynamic systems, and neuroscience** made it possible to get into something as **slippery as a dream**. And in a **non-human animal**.

Would it be possible to **see or feel how other animals experience the world**?

Only **science** will tell us.

## **Animals Are Incredible**  
They continually amaze us with their **unique colors, behaviors, and the complex ecosystems they inhabit**.

In **Cognitive Creatures**, you will discover their secrets and learn **why they are crucial for our planet**.

## **Some Questions for You**
- **Do you think animals are conscious?**  
- **What do you think another animal can dream about?**  
- **What animal would you like to learn about?** *We will write about it!*
