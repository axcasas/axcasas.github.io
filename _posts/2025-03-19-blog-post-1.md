Consciousness is arguably the biggest mystery of the universe.

It is about what it is like to be me, you, or another species. For some, it is about how matter becomes imagination (Tonini & Edelman, 1998). At its core, it is about subjective experiences.

This post serves as a friendly introduction to the topic.

I will focus on the neuroscience of consciousness, its philosophical background, how we study consciousness, and the most prominent theories.

Enjoy.

#### **Before You Read**

I’m not an expert on the topic. I have just read tons of papers about it and started to (indirectly) research it in birds.

Consciousness is a huge topic that cannot be summarized in a single article. This is just a general overview.

You can find all the 30 references I used at the bottom and throughout this article.

## **1. The Philosophical Problem**
For a long time, consciousness was only a topic for philosophers.

However, after the pioneering work by Crick & Koch (1990) (who suggested studying the neural correlates of consciousness), consciousness gained significant attention in the scientific community. Since then, many theories have been proposed (for a review, see Seth & Bayne, 2022).

Philosophy, its ideas, and its definitions shape how we do research.

### **A. -isms**
In *Being You: A New Science of Consciousness*, Anil Seth (2021) summarizes the -isms as:

- **Functionalism:** Consciousness depends on the functions performed by the brain, not on its physical structure.
- **Materialism:** Consciousness arises from physical processes in the brain.
- **Dualism:** Consciousness and physical reality are separate things.
- **Panpsychism:** Consciousness is a fundamental property of all matter.
- **Idealism:** Consciousness is the primary reality, and the physical world emerges from it.
- **Illusionism:** Consciousness is an illusion; it doesn’t exist as we experience it.

### **B. The Hard and the Easy Problem(s)**
David Chalmers (1995) argued that consciousness has two problems: the easy ones and the hard one.

- **Easy problems:** Finding the neural substrates for conscious perception, memory, and other behaviors.
- **Hard problem:** Explaining how the brain, a physical thing, creates a subjective experience.

Nagel (1980) proposed a smart and popular thought experiment to understand this problem:

> **What is it like to be a bat?**

Nagel argues that trying to imagine what the bat feels is incorrect. The correct answer is what the bat feels **as a bat**.

### **C. Phenomenological vs. Access Consciousness**
Block (1995) suggested distinguishing different kinds of consciousness:

- **Access consciousness:** The sensory information that becomes conscious.
- **Phenomenal consciousness:** Pure subjective experience.

The **hard problem** is explaining phenomenal consciousness, while **easy problems** are related to access consciousness.

### **D. Illusionism**
Illusionists deny the hard problem entirely.

For them, subjective experiences are **not mysterious**; they are just illusions our brains create (Frankish, 2016).

Some influential thinkers in this view are:
- **Daniel Dennett**
- **Keith Frankish**

## **2. How Neuroscientists Do Research On Consciousness?**
How neuroscientists study consciousness depends on **how they define it**.

Some classic experimental methods include:

### **1. Binocular Rivalry**
This occurs when each eye is shown a different image simultaneously.

- The brain alternates between them, making perception switch from one image to the other.
- This helps study the **neural correlates of conscious perception**.

### **2. Priming**
Priming occurs when exposure to one stimulus influences the response to another.

- Often, this happens without conscious awareness.
- Neuroscientists use this to explore **unconscious vs. conscious perception**.

### **3. Dreams**
Dreams provide a **natural state of altered consciousness**.

- Siclari et al. (2017) used **high-definition EEG** to predict dream content.
- They identified a **posterior cortical hot zone** activated when dreaming.

### **4. Other Methods**
- **The mirror test** (Boyle, 2017)
- **Psychedelics & altered states** (Yaden et al., 2021)
- **Metacognition experiments** (Fleming, 2023)
- **Illusions, such as the Rubber Hand Illusion** (Constantini & Haggard, 2007)

## **3. Two Theories of Consciousness**
Over the last decades, two main theories have dominated the field:

### **A. Integrated Information Theory (IIT)**
First proposed by **Giulio Tononi (2004)**, IIT suggests that **consciousness is integrated information**.

- It proposes a way to **measure** consciousness with **Phi**.
- It defines **five axioms** of experience: **intrinsicality, information, integration, exclusion, and composition** (Albantakis, 2023).
- The main problem? **Phi is impossible to falsify**.

A fair critique of IIT is found in **Scott Aaronson’s blog**:

### **B. Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT)**
Proposed by **Baars (1997, 2005)** and later refined by **Dehaene & Naccache (2001)**.

- **Consciousness happens when information enters the "global workspace" of the brain.**
- GNWT is **well-supported** by research (Mashour et al., 2020).
- However, **it focuses on access consciousness** rather than phenomenal consciousness.

Other theories include:
- **Higher Order Theory (HOT)** (LeDoux & Brown, 2017)
- **Prefrontal Perceptual Reality Monitoring (PRM)** (Lau, 2021)
- **Beast Machine Theory** (Seth & Tsakiris, 2018)

For a **review of 22 theories**, see **Seth & Bayne (2022).**

## **Final Thoughts**
Summarizing consciousness in one article is not fair.

My goal was to provide a **friendly introduction** to the topic. Philosophical ideas and consciousness theories were **violently summarized** here. If you are interested, I highly encourage you to read the **cited papers**.

I hope you enjoyed reading this.
