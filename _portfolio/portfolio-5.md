I used a Github Pages template for academic websites. This was forked from [here](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io), which was also forked (then detached) by [Stuart Geiger](https://github.com/staeiou) from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), which is Â© 2016 Michael Rose and released under the MIT License. See LICENSE.md.
