Most of the websites to generate QR images requires you to create a new account or to pay for a QR image.

Those that are "free" only allow users to create a single QR image or last a certain period of time. This project aims to provide a simple and free QR code generation tool accessible through a user-friendly web interface. With this app, users can create QR codes for various purposes, such as sharing URLs, contact information, or product details.

### Objectives

- Develop an easy and free user interface to create QR images.
- To create an app with customization options.
- To create a GUI that allows users to create as many QR images as they want.
