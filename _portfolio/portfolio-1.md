In this project I worked on automating the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Questionnaire (PSQI) in Python. This questionnaire is widely used in academia, and is also one of the most reliable. 

However, automating its result can be very tedious, since it is derived from the sum of 7 components. My goal was to create a google form template to automate the whole questionnaire output in a Python code. I hope that this project can facilitate the study, application, and analysis of the PSQI in Python. 

You can find the full code [here](https://github.com/axcasas/PSQI-Python)

Hope it helps!
