I was a teaching assistant in this research-oriented course, where I followed up the work from 4 students. My main job was to act as a supervisor, checking their progress and help them with all the organization of their work. For example, helping them in their introduction, gap, methdology, statistics, etc. 

The topics of my students were:
1. Game Addiction with fMRI
2. Consciousness
3. Psychedelics for psychological treatments
