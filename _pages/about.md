üë®üèΩ‚Äçüéì I'm a final year undergraduate student at the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina.

‚è∞ I'm currently working on my Bachelor's thesis about Chronotypes, Sleep Quality,
Digital Device Use, and Daylight Exposure. 

My main interests include Consciousness, Sleep, Time, Space, Animal Behavior and Cognition, and Animal Consciousness. 

My Experience
======
While finishing my Degree, I'm participating in several extra-academic positions that include disseminating neuroscience and psychology topics in [Neurotransmitiendo](https://www.neurotransmitiendo.org/) and helping organizing webinars in the Argentinian Society for Behavioral Science. 

I'm also participating as a teaching assistant in Neurophysiology, and Research Methods, and being a teacher colaborator in 'Applied Neurophysiology' where I give a lecture about circadian rhythms and sleep, and 'Updates in Cognitive Neuroscience', where I give a lecture about Brain Rhythms. 

Research
======
Since my very first year in my degree, I've been very interested in science, specifically about Neuroscience and Biology. This leaded me to start getting in touch with some researchers. 

I'm currently doing my thesis about chronotypes, sleep quality, digital device use, and light exposure. I'm also participating in a study about how different theoretical psychotherapies use information. 

But non-human animals are one of my biggest passions. I love to hang out and watch and identify birds. I'm always wondering what is going on inside their heads, and what the world looks like for them. This made me to join a research about parasitism in Cowbirds, where the objective is to gain more information about how the parasites are successfull in growing up and becoming adults.
