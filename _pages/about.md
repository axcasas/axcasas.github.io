üë®üèΩ‚Äçüéì I am a **psychologist** with a degree from the **University of Buenos Aires**, Argentina, currently pursuing a **PhD in Comparative Neuroscience and Psychology** at **Ruhr University Bochum** with a **DAAD scholarship**.  

üê¶ My research focuses on **social cognition in pigeons**, using a combination of **behavioral experiments, computational modeling, and fMRI techniques** to explore the cognitive abilities of birds.  

My broader research interests include **comparative psychology, the evolution of cognition, consciousness, sleep, and animal behavior**.  

## **My Journey**  

Science and animals have always been my greatest passions, but the road to my PhD was far from straightforward.  

From the beginning of my studies, I sought out opportunities beyond the classroom, engaging in **science communication** through [Neurotransmitiendo](https://www.neurotransmitiendo.org/), and helping organize webinars for the **Argentinian Society for Behavioral Science**, **NeuroTechX**, and other initiatives.  

I also developed a strong foundation in **teaching**, serving as an assistant in courses on **Neuroscience, Research Methods, Applied Neurophysiology, and Neuroanatomy**.  

However, the economic crisis in Argentina led me to explore career paths beyond academia. I worked as a **Data Analyst Coordinator at The Walt Disney Company**, applying **SQL, Excel, and Python** to analyze data and develop machine learning models. While this experience honed my analytical skills, I soon realized that my true passion lay in research.  

Fortunately, I was awarded a **DAAD PhD scholarship**, allowing me to return to academia and investigate the **evolution of social cognition** through the lens of the avian brain.
