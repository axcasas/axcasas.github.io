Circadian rhythms and sleep are crucial for our health. Here, with [Neurotransmitiendo](https://www.neurotransmitiendo.org/) we start by talking about chronotypes (our daily time preferences to go to sleep and wake up), sleep (the neuroscience behind the sleeping brain), and dreams (how we can even **predict** the content of our dreams and how animals may also experience them!)
